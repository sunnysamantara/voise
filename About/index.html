		Speech recognition works like this. You speak into a microphone and the computer transforms the sound of your words into text to be used by your word processor or other applications available on your computer. The computer may repeat what you just said or it may give you a prompt for what you are expected to say next. This is the central promise of interactive speech recognition software. However, you cannot really use “natural speech” as claimed by the manufacturers. You must speak clearly, as you do when you speak to a Dictaphone or when you leave someone a telephone message. Remember, the computer is relying solely on your spoken words. It cannot interpret your tone or inflection, and it cannot interpret your gestures and facial expressions, which are part of everyday human communication. Some of the systems also look at whole phrases, not just the individual words you speak. They try to get information from the context of your speech, to help work out the correct interpretation. This is how they can (sometimes) work out what you mean when there are several words that sound similar (such as “to”, “too” and “two”.)

		Speech recognition allows you to provide input to a system with your voice. Just like clicking with your mouse, typing on your keyboard, or pressing a key on the phone keypad provides input to an application, speech recognition allows you to provide input by talking. In the desktop world, you need a microphone to be able to do this.
